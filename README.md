Code for the paper, 'Reformulating Parallel-Connected Lithium-Ion Battery Pack Dynamics with Interconnection Resistances as Ordinary Differential Equations' by Jaffar Ali Lone, Nilsu Atlan, Simone Fasolato, Davide M. Raimondo and Ross Drummond.

This work presents analytical solutions for the current distribution in lithium-ion battery packs composed of cells connected in parallel, explicitly accounting for the presence of interconnection resistances. These solutions enable the reformulation of the differential-algebraic equations describing the pack dynamics into a set of ordinary differential equations, thereby simplifying simulation and analysis. Conditions under which uniform current sharing across all cells occurs are also derived. The proposed formulation is validated against experimental data and confirms its ability to capture the key behaviours induced by interconnection resistances. These results can support the improved design and control of parallel-connected battery packs.
